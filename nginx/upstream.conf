# Initial NGINX Upstream Configuration
# This file provides fallback upstreams for container startup
# It will be replaced by the Dynamic Load Balancer once Spring Boot starts

# Fallback upstream for backward compatibility
upstream backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;  # Placeholder - will be updated dynamically
}

# Fallback upstream for incoming requests
upstream backend_incoming {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;  # Placeholder - will be updated dynamically
}

# Fallback upstream for outgoing requests
upstream backend_outgoing {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;  # Placeholder - will be updated dynamically
}

# Note: This configuration will be automatically replaced by the
# Dynamic Load Balancer application within a few seconds of startup.
# The application will generate the proper configuration with actual
# backend servers and their weights.
